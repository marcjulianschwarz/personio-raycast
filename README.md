# Personio

## Track your time with Personio.

## First start:
You need to have your companies personio _clientid_ & _clientsecret_.
These can be obtained by your personio admin [Personio][https://developer.personio.de/docs/getting-started-with-the-personio-api?ref=intro]

Next step is to set a timezone from the dropdown menu. 
(If your timezone is not listed contact @marcjulian or @boosteblume.)

Last step is to use the 'Find Employee' function and copy your _employeeid_.
You will need your _employeeid_ the first time you start the other functions.

## Use Cases:

### Find Employee Number
This function can be used to identify your _employeeid_.

### Attendances

### Track Time
This function can be used to upload your times to personio. 
It need the __start_time__, __end_time__ and __break_time__
